* About Super Org Mode
Use org-mode for project management with a group
- Shared collection of files that are shared by multiple clients
- Real-time updates to all clients
- Literally just a text file
- Web reporter (read-only) that updates whenever a file changes
- Edit locally, share globally
- Never need to leave emacs
- WTAF
- yo
** Implementation
*** File watching and updating
1) As soon as a file is changed all clients are sent the latest version
- Use emacs idle-timer to poll for changes from the master
- Use emacs run-with-timer which is used by auto-revert-set-timer to auto revert buffers when files change but are not modified
- If there is a new version, download it
2) On save, synchronizes with master
- Send the changed file, previous version of the file
- Server attempts to merge the file with master copy using three way merge (diff3)
  - Command: diff3 -m changedfile previousfile masterfile
  - Need to wrap the files with atoms to synchronize changes across threads
- If there is a conflict that can not be resolved on merge, reject the save and return the file with diff3 notes
- On reject, the client pulls opens up ediff with the output of the merge
- Client saves file after resolving conflict, back to step 2
3) Master notifies clients of the change
- Export org file to json
- Push json to websocket sessions
- Call web hooks
4) Re-render the web reporter
- Take the json output and use templates to generate the view
*** Export to json
ox-json is a backend for org export that emits json as a list of outlines where outlines are nested dictionaries
*** Web reporter
- A webserver that serves the view of the org mode generated from the todo files.
- Holds a websocket connection with the client browser and pushes a new version of all the json to re-render the view
- Options for how to view the project
- Timeline view
- List view
- Card view
  - Each outline is a swimlane
  - Each TODO is a card
